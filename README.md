## Development

- Install all dependencies & the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/):

  ```sh
  npm install
  npm install netlify-cli -g
  ```

- Create or connect to your Netlify project by running through the Netlify `init` script:

  ```sh
  netlify init
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Running Locally

The Remix dev server starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes. To start the Remix dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The Netlify CLI builds a production version of your Remix App Server and splits it into Netlify Functions that run locally. This includes any custom Netlify functions you've developed. The Netlify CLI runs all of this in its development mode.

It will pull in all the [environment variables](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/#declare-variables) of your Netlify project.

To start the Netlify development environment:

```sh
netlify dev
```

With Netlify Dev you can also:

- test functions
- test redirects
- share a live session via url with `netlify dev --live`
- [and more](https://cli.netlify.com/netlify-dev/) :)

Note: When running the Netlify CLI, file changes will rebuild assets, but you will not see the changes to the page you are on unless you do a browser refresh of the page. Due to how the Netlify CLI builds the Remix App Server, it does not support hot module reloading.

## Deployment

This stack has the Netlify [configuration file (netlify.toml)](./netlify.toml) that contains all the information needed to deploy your project to Netlify's [edge nodes](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge).

Want to deploy immediately? Click this button

[![Deploy to Netlify Button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/nextjs-toolbox)

Clicking this button will start the setup for a new project and deployment.

### Deploy from the Command Line

Clone this repo with the `git clone` command. Then install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) tool and run `netlify init`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/kpop-stack

npm install netlify-cli -g # to install the Netlify CLI tool globally

netlify init # initialize a new Netlify project & deploy
```

### CI/CD

Using the 'Deploy to Netlify' button or the `init` process will also set up continuous deployment for your project so that a new build will be triggered & deployed when you push code to the repo (you can change this from your project dashboard: Site Settings/Build & deploy/Continuous Deployment).

You can also use `netlify deploy` or `netlify deploy --prod` to manually deploy then `netlify open` to open your project dashboard.

> ðŸ’¡ If you don't use `--prod` on the deploy command you will deploy a preview of your application with a link to share with teammates to see the site deployed without deploying to production

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
